# bird-watching

This **was** my birdwatching list. I have now moved all of my lists to [eBird](http://ebird.org/), and I no longer keep this updated.

eBird is an awesome site that uses logged information for citizen science. People all around the world note what they see and when, and upload that information to a centralized site, where scientists can track movements and populations over years. It's an astounding effort and site, and it makes birding more useful, as opposed to me merely logging the inevitable splitting of evolution.

Go use it! If you have any questions, hit me up. I am always happy to talk about birds.
