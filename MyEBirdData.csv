Round head, completely white except for black tail feathers, and small - suspected Snow Goose initially, but they didn't fit with the ones I'd seen before in Vermont and Quebec. The bill was grey from my vantage point, but I was quite far away. Debated this a lot, here, and after, and decided on a Ross identification for a few reason: the bill was small and triangular, and not large enough for a Snow; there was a lack of the huge grin on a Snow Goose; and the birds themselves were noticeably smaller than the Canada Geese. The all-white head lacked any rust-color I'd expect to see in a Snow Goose, too.","Saw a flock of geese in the small pond from the car, swerved in"

While standing outside of the Adamant Community Art Center, I heard a low waaah call, very similar to a gull. Looking towards the church down the road, I saw a large, gull-sized bird with white underwings curl over and land on a branch. I took off running and got close enough to see it was a bulky accipiter species. It was too small to be a Red-tailed Hawk, the other main hawk in the area. However, the light was not good, and its tail seemed shorter than I expected for an accipiter. The temperature was roughly 4°F, and I now think that it was intentionally fluffing its feathers and staying compact in order to stay warm. When it took off, it lacked the normal accipiter quick wing bears, and seemed to have more rounded wing tips. The white underside was still evident, with a dark back. Having listened to calls online, and considering the initial white flash, the size of the bird (too large to be a Cooper, definitely not a Sharpie), the slow wing beats, the rounded wing shape, I'm fairly confident this was a Goshawk. However, I don't know why it gave a 'waah' call, as those are traditionally near a nest. I can't explain it.",While standing outside of the Adamant Community Art Center
