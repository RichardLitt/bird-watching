# Japan Trip: November 3rd-November 15th

To see:
- Pacific Swift
- Japanese Thrush
- Azure-Winged Magpie
- Jungle Crow
- Japanese Cormorant
- Varied Tit

Notes after reading some PDFs from _Bird Research News_:
- Azure-Wing Magpies should be in small flocks.
- Look for Common Cuckoos, Carrion Crows, Large-Billed Crows (Jungle Crows).

## To Do

- [ ] See if you can research the Hwamei.
- [ ] Look up the Common Cuckoo
- [ ] White Wagtails have overlapping ranges with Japanese Wagtails: Look up the difference.
- [ ] Difference between Carrion Crow and Jungle Crows
