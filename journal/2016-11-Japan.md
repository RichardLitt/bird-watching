# Japan Trip: November 3rd-November 15th

To see:
- Pacific Swift
- Japanese Thrush
- Azure-Winged Magpie
- Jungle Crow
- Japanese Cormorant
- Varied Tit

Notes after reading some PDFs from _Bird Research News_:
- Azure-Wing Magpies should be in small flocks.
- Look for Common Cuckoos, Carrion Crows, Large-Billed Crows (Jungle Crows).

## November 5th

Went for a walk out in the garden near Yokkaichi this morning. There was a Meadow Bunting on a tree top, singing, and a few tree sparrows bouncing around. The Meadow Bunting was new. I borrowed some binoculars and went out. Hiyodori - Brown-eared Bulbul - were everywhere, crying. I saw a few more sparrows and Meadow Bunting, and heard a good deal more. I think I saw a Japanese Leaf Warbler.

### On Mt. Gozaisho

While I heard a good amount of birds, I only saw a few species. Of course, Jungle crows were everywhere, and I heard a good deal of hiyodori. I managed to see a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, identified after by process of elimination of Japanese woodpeckers. Halfway up the mountain, my host pointed out two Coal Tits to me, up in a pine tree - identified after by process of elimination, too. On top of the mountain, I thought I might have seen a Black Kite, but looking at the form later online, I don't think it could have been, it wasn't large enough. Looking online now, I se that ravens soar; that must have been what this was.

### Walking at night

This was largely uninteresting; Tree Sparrows tend to shut up when you walk near them, and hiyodori are horrifying when they cry. But I also saw two Daurian Redstarts, identified afterwards by the large white patch on the wing, and the black-ish neck. Looking from below, I thought the entire head was black, but I don't seem to see that now, online. I'm worried that I didn't see the light crown. I'm not sure if I have correctly identified this, and will have to leave it off; the bird I saw had a greener underbelly, a brown head, and dakr wings with a white patch. Unfortunately, due to the dusk and my colorblindness, I'm not sure that the bottom was green, at all. I saw many cormorants flying overhead.

## November 6

Went out at around 6:30. There were some hiyodori, meadow bunting (houjiro), tree sparrows (suzume), and crows (karasu). I walked around for a while; I saw a Grey Heron, which I've already seen in Britain, but was new to this country. I saw a few Bull-Headed Shrike, which I thought was two species, but afterwards researched and discovered were just one new species. I also saw some female Daurian Redstarts, but no males - or they're discolored as it isn't breeding season. I also saw a bird that I couldn't identify at all, a larger bird with a breast something like a starling. I think it might have been an immature cuckoo, but the coloration was so regular and dark that that doesn't sound right. I don't know what it is. I wandered a bit out of the way to follow a bird of prey I thought I saw in the distance, but I couldn't find it again.

## To Do
- [ ] Find the Pacific Swift. House Swifts appear to be very rare and only in a few colonies. May be possible to find somewhere, though.
- [ ] See if you can research the Hwamei.
- [ ] Look up the Common Cuckoo
- [ ] White Wagtails have overlapping ranges with Japanese Wagtails: Look up the difference.
- [ ] Difference between Carrion Crow and Jungle Crows
